### Unit Testing with vitest  

What you need to do in this submission is to create the following 7 tests for the functions found in src/functions.ts.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

### Requirements Specification & Hygiene Specification  

The tests should be written using vitest and should be located in src/tests/functions.test.ts.  
  
You should group your tests using describe and it to make it easy to understand what is being tested, and you should use expect to make your assertions.  

In parentheses, the minimum number of expect statements that should be in each test is specified. Of course, you should write more if you believe it's necessary. The important thing is to test all possible paths through your code.  

Remember that each test should be isolated and not affect other tests. You can achieve this by using beforeEach and afterEach to set up and clean up after each test.
